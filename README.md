# UTKBudgetExtractor

This script is made to parse the UTK grant proposal budget spreadsheet into a file of tex-compatible commands that can be imported into a budget justification document. Usage:

```
python UTKBudgetExtractor.py /path/to/budget.xlsx
```

Updated to the version of the central spreadsheet from Feb 1, 2023.
